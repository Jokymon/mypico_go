MyPicoGo
========

This project aims at documenting in as much detail as possible all the hardware that is
part of the [Waveshare PicoGo robot](https://www.waveshare.com/picogo.htm). The information
and the documentation was collected from the [Waveshare PicoGo Wiki](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/PicoGo),
from studying the robot and from researching information on the internet.

The documentation is written using Sphinx and be found as a deployed GitHub pages page
under this URL: [https://jokymon.github.io/mypico_go/](https://jokymon.github.io/mypico_go/)

In addition you will find my slightly modified, cleaned up or even improved versions of
the original PicoGo Python sources under the ``mybot`` directory in this project.
